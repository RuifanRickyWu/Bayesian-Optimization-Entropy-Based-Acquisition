# Objectives
The objective of this thesis project is construct entropy based acquisition functions (i.e., Entropy Search, Predictive Entropy Search and Max Value Entropy Search) that can be used in a Bayesian optimization setting where we use the statistics from a GP posterior distibution to compute the search policy for ES, PES and/or MES.
In a Bayesian optimization setting, we compare the performance of these acquisition functions against other common acquisition functions such as probability of improvement, expected improvement, lower confidence bound and / or Thompson sampling.
If time permits, we can extend this work to the setting of optimization under uncertainty where we have Gaussian process models for robustness metrics (optional).
